sell 100 limit 23.5 FOK # fill-or-kill sell 100 shares at limit of 23.5 (don't sell below that)
# last order will be matched with the first order, market price is now set at 23.5
# market price 23.5 activates the stop order set at 23, it's added to the books but isn't matched since there aren't opposing sellers
sell 150 limit 24 # sell 150 shares at market price
# sell order is matched with the recently activated stop order and sold at price of 24
# the new market price is now 24, which activates the first stop order and is sold at price of 25
# the sell order has been matched first against the order 1 market bid, then the last stop bid at price 25 and
# then at the first stop bid at price 24
# stop orders have not been matched in order of time when they were added to the books, but ordered by price and then time
